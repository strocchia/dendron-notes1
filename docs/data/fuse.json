Try it in the editor pane now.\n\nExample: [[tutorial]]\n\n[[Today's journal|daily.journal.2021.12.18]]\n\nTo navigate to the note in the link, you can just click on the link in the preview pane. In the editor pane, you can move the cursor into the link and hit `CTRL+ENTER`.\n\nYou can switch back to the previous note with the tab switching shortcut (`Ctrl+Tab` on most systems).\n\n#### Backlinks\n\nTake a look at the backlinks panel on the bottom left section of your sidebar.

This is a shortcut for the `Dendron: Lookup Note` command.\n\n> 💡 The lookup command is the main way to interact with Dendron. It is used for both looking up your notes and creating new notes. When you do a lookup on a note that hasn't been created, Dendron will create it for you. Remember the `Cmd+L` shortcut.\n\n> 🌱 Try it yourself - bring up the lookup bar with Cmd+L. Type `recipes` and hit Enter. Afterward, you can use the `Ctrl+Tab` shortcut to get back to this note.\n\nThis should have created a note named `recipes.md`. Notes in Dendron are just plaintext markdown. They live in your file system and are portable across any platform, which makes it very easy to import/ export your notes and even to publish your notes to a hosted website. You can try to add some content to the body of your `recipes` note now.\n\nThe --- section at the top of each note is frontmatter. Frontmatter are custom attributes at the top of each markdown file. Dendron uses it to store metadata about each note for features like publishing. Don't modify the id attribute on the front matter.\n\n### Creating a hierarchy\n\nDendron uses flexible hierarchies to help you organize your notes. It's how people are able to manage tens of thousands of notes inside Dendron.\n\n> 🌱 To create a hierarchy, bring up lookup again `(Cmd+L)`. Type `recipes.vegetarian` and then press enter.\n\nYou have now created your first hierarchy. Hierarchies in Dendron are created by having a `.` delimiter in the file name. Take a look at the tree view in the side panel to see that the `vegetarian` note exists under the `recipes` hierarchy. You can also see in the Workspace panel that the note file is stored as `recipes.vegetarian.md`.\n\nYou can create a hierarchy at any level:\n\n> 🌱 Type the following into lookup and hit enter: `recipes.italian.desserts.tiramisu`\n\nYou'll notice in the tree view that there is now a `+` sign next to `italian` and `desserts`. The plus sign indicates that this note is a stub. A stub is a placeholder for a note that hasn't actually been created. Dendron uses stubs to avoid cluttering your file system with empty notes when creating hierarchies.\n\n![Tree View](https://org-dendron-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tutorial-tree-view.png)\n\nFollowing this recipes example, you can try creating other notes that might be relevant. Some examples:\n\n- `recipes.italian.appetizers`\n- `recipes.chinese`\n- `recipes.chinese.appetizers`\n- `recipes.ingredients.favorites`\n- `recipes.ingredients.shopping-list`\n\nHierarchies are flexible, and you can create them in whichever way works best for you. Dendron allows you to easily change the hierarchies later if you change your mind on how to organize your notes.\n\n### Finding Notes\n\nTo find notes, we use the same lookup interface that we used to create them.\n\n> 🌱 Open Lookup, and type `vege`. This will find your `recipes.vegetarian` note. Hit `Enter` to open that note.\n\nThe lookup uses fuzzy search which means you can type out partial results and still see the results. Searching with \\* wildcards is also supported.\n\nWhen combined with hierarchies, this fast lookup system enables you to find your notes very quickly, even if you have thousands of notes in your vaults.\n\nIf you want to search for content within the notes, you can use VS Code's built-in search tools with `Cmd+Shift+F`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- Tutorial Step 3: [[Linking Your Notes|tutorial.3-linking-your-notes]]\n\n---\n\n[[Tutorial Home Page| tutorial]]\n","n":0.043}}},{"i":7,"$":{"0":{"v":"Navigation Basics","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nLet's do a brief overview on how to navigate the Dendron UI.\n\n_Quick note on running commands in VS Code:_\n\n> If you're unfamiliar with VS Code, the command palette is used to quickly run commands, including the commands for Dendron. To bring up the command palette, use `Cmd+Shift+P` and start typing the command. Throughout the tutorial, if you see instructions telling you to run a command, remember to bring up the command palette and then type the command name to run it.\n\n![Basic UI](https://org-dendron-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tutorial-layout.png)\n\n#### 1. Editor Pane\n\nThis is where you can write and edit your notes. Notes in Dendron are Markdown files.\n\n#### 2. Preview Pane\n\nThis shows the rendered Markdown of what your currently opened note looks like. If you close this pane, you can always bring it back by opening the command palette `Cmd+Shift+P` and running the `Dendron: Show Preview` command.\n\n> 💡 The preview pane is read-only and cannot be used to edit notes. All editing must be done in the editor pane.\n\n#### 3. Dendron Workspace\n\nThis shows the files in your vault. A vault is where Dendron stores your markdown notes, assets, and some other helper files. Clicking on a note here will open it into the editor pane.\n\n#### 4. Outline\n\nShows an outline of the currently opened note. This observes the header levels in the Markdown of the note.\n\n#### 5. Tree View\n\nThis shows a hierarchical view of your notes, similar to how a folder structure would appear in your filesystem. You can also click in the tree view to navigate around your notes.\n\n#### 6. Backlinks\n\nThis shows a list of other notes that have links to the current note. More on links in Section 3 of the tutorial.\n\n> 💡 VS Code lets you reposition any of these windows as you'd like, so feel free to rearrange the windows into the view that works best for you!\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- You've completed navigation basics!
